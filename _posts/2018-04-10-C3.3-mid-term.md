**Material Threshold Limit Warning**

Unexpected material “out of stock” event is something that no company want to face with. 

However if this still happens, there are few options that can be undertaken to prevent negative influence on a regular business flow:

**1.** Supplier should be immediately contacted and a new material delivery should be requested.

**2.** If the supplier is not able to provide the requested delivery another supplier(s) should be contacted.

**3.** After this, it should be investigated why the material stock was not managed properly and make sure that this doesn’t happen again. A regular material stock check should be one of the most important jobs which has to be done on a regular basis in order to prevent discontinuity in the process flow. Another option would be to introduce a material threshold “indicator” which would announce that the material stock is approaching the threshold limit.
