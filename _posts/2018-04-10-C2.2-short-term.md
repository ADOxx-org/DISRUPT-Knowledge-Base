**Truck Operator Injured**

In case when truck operator experiences some injury and is not capable to continue driving there are few steps that are to be undertaken from both sides, truck operator as well as the company.

**1.** Truck operator should pull over the truck at the first safe place.

**2.** Truck operator should call the ambulance and ask for help.

**3.** Truck operator should inform the company that he is not able to finish the ride.

**4.** The company should have already prepared a plan how to proceed in such situations in order to be able to react fast and save some time.

**5.** First to be done is to locate the place where the truck operator interrupted the ride.

**6.** Next to check is if the truck is operable or it also needs to be replaced.

**7.** Immediately another driver and potentially a truck should be sent.

**8.** Before sending the new driver and the truck it should be checked if the delivery is in a good shape or itâ€™s also damaged.

**9.** If the delivery content is damaged then it makes no sense to send another driver and the truck. If this delivery was essential, a supplier has to be informed and, if possible, another delivery has to be requested.

**10.** If the supplier cannot send another delivery, another supplier is to be contacted.
