**Machine Renovation**

Industrial and manufacturing equipment is often the largest capital expense for a business. Even a small manufacturing plant's few machines can be well over a million dollars. That said, "Time is money," and when machines are not operating, businesses begin losing money immediately. These losses continue to increase until a solution can be reached.
After a manufacturing loss, capacity and lead times are the critical issues facing a business. 
For instance, the following questions should be answered in this case:

**1.** Does an insured have the capacity on other machines or at other facilities to meet their production goals? 

**2.** If not, can an outside company be located to outsource work to without comprising the insured's clients and production quality?  

When deciding if a machine can be decontaminated, repaired, refurbished or needs replacement, the most important factor is often lead time. A new machine may be desirable, but lead times can often be 90 or 120 days and even longer in cases of highly specialized equipment.
