In case when the truck with material is delayed, there are some steps that can be undertaken to prevent negative influence on a regular business flow:

  1) Check the Truck delay KPI value in the Dashboard <button class="btn btn-default" onclick="javascript:alert('To be implemented');">Open Dashboard</button>
  
  2) Contact the truck driver in order to confirm the estimated delay
  - In case the delay is lower than 15 minutes do nothing 
  - In case the delay is between 15 and 60 minutes launch the <button class="btn btn-default" onclick="javascript:alert('To be implemented');">CNR Dock Rescheduling</button>
  - In case the delay is greater than 60 minutes notify the production rescheduler responsible
  
  3) Check the Criticity Level KPI value in the Dashboard
 - In case the Criticity Level is VERY HIGH start the <button class="btn btn-default" onclick="javascript:alert('To be implemented');">AUEB Production Rescheduler</button> 
  
  
<!--
**1.** Contact supplier, inform about the delay and ask about the reasons of delivery as well as the new expected delivery time.

**2.** Supplier should cover all potential material losses.

**3.** Contact another supplier and ask for a delivery.

**4.** Bild material reserves in order to keep usual business flow even if such events occur.

**5.** If obligations to some customer are endangered, contact the customer, apology and kindly ask for a deadline prolongation.
