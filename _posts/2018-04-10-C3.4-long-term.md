**BP Optimization**

Business Process Optimization is the act of taking your old business processes and optimizing them for efficiency. The general idea is to make it more efficient – the means of doing that, however, can vary a lot. 

BP Optimization includes the three most important steps, such us:

**1. Identify** - Once you determine which business process needs an overhaul, the first step is to list out all the key components of the process. These should be fundamental, unchangeable aspects of the process.

**2. Rethink** - This phase should address your unique methodology and reveal potential areas for improvement. Think about every step that is involved in the business process you’re analyzing.

**3. Automate** - Repeat unnecessary tasks, and workflow stalls. Repeat successful tactics, and business flourishes. Once you’ve separated the essential from the non-essential in your business process, it’s time to apply a solution.
