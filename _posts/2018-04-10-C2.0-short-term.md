**Truck Accident and Material Lost**

In the case of the traffic accident where material is damaged or destroyed the company could suffer in many aspects. 

There are some steps that can be undertaken in order to minimize the material losses and other potential inconveniences, such as:

**1.** Insure the material during the transport, if the company is responsible for the transport.

**2.** If the supplier is responsible for the transport, request another delivery immediately.

**3.** If possible use some other, safer and more reliable transportation option, such as rail transportation.

**4.** Build some material reserves which can be used to backup business when such unexpected events occur.

**5.** Contact another supplier.

**6.** If possible, avoid full dependency on only one supplier.
