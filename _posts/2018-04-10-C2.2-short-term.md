**Truck Operator Injured**

What You Need to Do as an Injured Truck Driver:

**1.** If you are at work, politely inform your supervisor that you need to leave to seek medical care. Youâ€™ll be happy to discuss what happened later, but now you need to get to the doctor.

**2.** Make notes about who was on the job with you (including employees from other companies), what work was being performed, and what happened to cause your injury.

**3.**	Leave the job site and go to an urgent care center or an emergency room. Immediately report your injury or occupational disease to a physician.  Make sure you have identified your belief that your injury or new symptoms are occupationally-related.
