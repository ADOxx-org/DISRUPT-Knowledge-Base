**Operator Injured**

What you need to do as an injured operator:

1. If you are at work, politely inform your supervisor that you need to leave to seek medical care. You’ll be happy to discuss what happened later, but now you need to get to the doctor.

2. Make notes about who was on the job with you, what work was being performed, and what happened to cause your injury.

3. Leave the job site and go to an urgent care center or an emergency room. Immediately report your injury or occupational disease to a physician.  Make sure you have identified your belief that your injury or new symptoms are occupationally-related.
