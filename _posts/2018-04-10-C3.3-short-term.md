**Material Sold Out**

Material is the most important part of the production and if material is out of stock, the production is stopped. 

In order to prevent this the company should:

**1.** Have a proper management and a regular check of the material stock.

**2.**	If it happens that material is out of stock, the company should immediately contact the supplier and request another delivery.

**3.**  If the supplier is not able to deliver the material in time, another supplier should be contacted.

**4.** In order to avoid production stop because of lack of material, the company should have some material reserve which are separated from other material stock which is used in the regular production process.

**5.** Company should implement material stock indicator which would alarm if the material is below some pre-defined minimum
