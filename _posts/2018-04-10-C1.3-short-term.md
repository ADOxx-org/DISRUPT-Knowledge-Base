**Supplier Material Sold Out**

If the company is totally dependent on only one supplier, such scenario as sold out material could be quite inconvenient event. If the supplier’s out of material causes a cancelation of already agreed and scheduled delivery, the supplier should take care of this situation and take necessary steps to find the way to fulfil its obligation.

1. It could happen that there was no agreed delivery or that the supplier has no option how to fulfil its contract obligation, the company should have a “backup” plan prepared. This means that the company should have either the material reserves which would insure business continuity and fulfilment of company’s obligation to the customers or to have another supplier who can provide needed material. 

2. The best option would be to have more than only one supplier, diversify the risk and avoid full dependency on only one supplier.
