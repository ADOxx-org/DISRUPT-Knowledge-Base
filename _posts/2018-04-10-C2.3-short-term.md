**Truck with Material Delay**

In case when the truck with material is delayed, there are few options that can be undertaken to prevent negative influence on a regular business flow:

1. Contact supplier, inform about the delay and ask about the reasons of delivery as well as the new expected delivery time.

2. Supplier should cover all potential material losses.

3. Contact another supplier and ask for a delivery.

5. Bild material reserves in order to keep usual business flow even if such events occur.

6. If obligations to some customer are endangered, contact the customer, apology and kindly ask for a deadline prolongation.
