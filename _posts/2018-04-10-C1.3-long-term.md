**Innovation on Materials**

Today, materials development cannot be so far behind the product development cycle. 

Advanced materials are revolutionizing the way companies do business and at any given time, a company or its competitors may launch a new material or application that unlocks revenue potential and market share, meets unmet customer needs, achieves profitability goals or satisfies sustainability and regulatory requirements.

There are many reasons why companies focus on advanced materials development or applications. Some common examples: 

**1. Reduced costs and increased profitability** - Advanced materials that are stronger, lighter and more durable will last longer and save money on replacing parts or can compensate for operational and manufacturing challenges unsolved by relatively less functional materials.

**2. Increased customer satisfaction and loyalty** - Because of their inherently improved properties, advanced materials can lead to final products that better fulfill customer requirements and contain fewer defects, which will translate into increased competitiveness.

**3. Regulatory compliance and sustainability** -  Newer and more stringent regulations are making manufacturing and production more and more arduous. Using advanced materials should help companies comply with regulations without sacrificing performance objectives.
