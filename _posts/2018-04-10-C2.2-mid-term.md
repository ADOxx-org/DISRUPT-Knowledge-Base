**Planned Strike**

In case  of truck transport strike the best way to respond in this situation is to have a plan before it happens. Few people can think clearly and logically in a crisis, so it is important to do so in advance, when you have time to be thorough. The plan can contain next few steps:

**1.** The first and most difficult step involves alternate resource allocation, which is the development of list of employees that are willing and able to function as replacements for the absent employees (in this situation truck drivers).

**2.** Ensures that each business unit that will be affected by work stoppage has a contingency plan in place. 

**3.** Operationalize the plan.

**4.** Predict potentially significant operating costs to the company, which must be funded (allocation to be preplanned and for on demand situations).
