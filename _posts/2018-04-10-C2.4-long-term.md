**Fuel Consumption Increased Warning Light**

One of the key ingredients your engine needs to run correctly is fuel. 

There are some tips how to reduce fuel consumption: 

**1.** Avoid overloading. Every vehicle has a specific weight limit. So always make sure you do not over load your vehicle as this can lead to an increase in the amount of fuel used.

**2.** Service your vehicle on time. During motor-vehicle servicing, a number of things are checked and if found with fault they are replaced. However, if you do not service your car whenever service is due, the spoilt parts will increase your fuel consumption.

**3.** Balance your tyre pressure. Unbalanced tyre pressure also leads to excess fuel usage.

**4.** Switch off the engine if the vehicle is not moving. When stuck in traffic jam, you should switch off the engine so as not to waste fuel.
