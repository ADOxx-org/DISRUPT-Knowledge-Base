**Measurement Sensor Broken**

Characterizing the nature of the change can identify the reason for change in sensor performance. Knowing what type of influence is imposed on the sensor enables the operator to narrow down the root cause and develop a solution to the problem. Following is a process to accomplish this.

**1.** Installation shift is the easiest to identify and the most simple to fix. Most always it has already been compensated or adjusted for after installation. Graphically this can be done by subtracting the magnitude of the installation shift from all subsequent sensor readings. If the performance is otherwise fairly level then that was the problem.

**2.** Unfortunately in many cases long-term data is unavailable to analyze to determine the root cause of the problem. In these cases the problem is usually either identified by an operator frustrated by the need for frequent calibration or the output has shifted so much that the sensor can no longer be calibrated into an acceptable range.


**3.** In the case of frustration caused by frequent calibrations, if each time that calibration is performed the operator notes in which direction the output needed adjustment, it would only take a few calibrations (no less than three but more is better) before a determination could be made.

**4.** If the adjustment always had to be made in the same direction it is probably drift; but if the direction changes then it is either the result of barometric pressure changes or installation shift. Installation shift can be ruled out by always taking the measurement before uninstalling the sensor and calibrating it after it is installed. If the problem is still manifest after doing this then it is a drift problem; if not then the problem is an installation shift issue.

**5.** In instances when the sensor output can no longer be calibrated, the problem is either drift or damage to the sensor. In this case the best alternative is to return it to the supplier if it is within warranty and discard it if it is not.
