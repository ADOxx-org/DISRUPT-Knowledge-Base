**Measurement Sensor Broken**

Different processes and process performances such as time, quality or some other measurements are often monitored and controlled using different sensors. If all sensors work properly it’s easy to monitor any process, but what when some sensor is broken?
If a sensor is broken, this can cause more or less harm to the whole process, depending on the importance of the task, the sensor is connected to.

Here are some checks and steps how to perform in case of the unresponsive sensor:

**1.** Implement double checks (wherever it’s possible) for each task (process) and assign employees to regularly check the processes personally and control if sensors work.

**2.** If sensor is broken it’s essential to react fast. 

**3.** Stop the process.

**4.** Try to fix the sensor with basic “turn off/turn on” action.

**5** If this doesn’t work, try to redirect the process to another machine.

**6.** At the same time turn off the broken machine, unplug and put it out of use.

**7.** Contact machine producer and ask for a support.

**8.** If needed send the machine for a repair.
