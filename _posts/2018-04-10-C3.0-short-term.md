**Fire Alarm**

When the fire alarm sounds, act immediately to ensure your safety. The fire alarm system is designed and engineered to provide you with an early warning to allow you to safely exit the building during an emergency situation.

**1.** 	Never ignore or assume the alarm is false or the result of a test.

**2.** Everyone must evacuate the building by way of the safest and closest exit and/or stairway.

**3.** Never use an elevator to exit during a fire alarm activation.

**4.** Shut down equipment.

**5.** Lock and secure cash drawers and valuables.

**6.** Close (but do not lock) office or lab doors.

**7.** Proceed to the nearest marked emergency exit on each floor.

**8.** Once outside the building, move away from the building. 

**9.** Once outside, never re-enter the building until you are told to do so by the fire department.
