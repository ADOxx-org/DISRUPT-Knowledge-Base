**Truck Engine Warning Light:**

The orange, engine-shaped icon that sometimes appears, itâ€™s a sign that something is wrong under the hood. Ignoring it could leave you stranded at the worst possible moment, cost you thousands, or both. If the check engine light comes on, here are some tips on what you should do:

1. Look for a serious problem that requires immediate attention. Check your dashboard gauges and lights for indications of low oil pressure or overheating. These conditions mean you should pull over and shut off the engine as soon as you can find a safe place to do so. On some vehicle , a yellow check engine light means investigate the problem and a red one means stop right now. 

2. Try tightening your gas cap. This can often solve the problem. Keep in mind that it may take several trips before the light resets. Some vehicles have a separate indicator that warns of a loose gas cap.

3.	Reduce speed and load. If the check engine light is blinking or you notice any serious performance problems, such as a loss of power, reduce your speed and try to reduce the demands on the engine. For example, it would be a good idea to stop towing a trailer. Have the vehicle checked as soon as possible to prevent expensive damage.

4. Use built-in diagnostic services, if available.
