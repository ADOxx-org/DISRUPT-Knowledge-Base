**Natural Disaster Involving Supplier Company**


When a natural disaster strikes, your business could suffer loss of revenue and even catastrophic end of business events. 

There are some steps that can be undertaken such as:

**1.** When disaster strikes, you need to have a solid plan of action in place so you can deal with the effects and position your company for success. You need to look past your immediate suppliers to the suppliers of your suppliers or the critical customers of your suppliers, "anything that might impact your suppliers‚Äù ability to serve you.

**2.** Once you have successfully identified your biggest risks you can take remedial action. Have a conversation with your customers to show customer centricity and sensitize them to what can happen given the situation.

**3.** Have a plan, write it down, show it to other people, and ask them to tell you what is wrong with it. Have an approach that says: This is what we are going to do. This is why we are going to do it. This is why we think it is better than anything else we can do, and this is how we know if we did it right.
