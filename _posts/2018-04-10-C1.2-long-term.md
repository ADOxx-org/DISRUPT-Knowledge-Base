**Mass Layoffs on Supplier Company**

Mass layoffs on supplier company can have a higher or lower negative effect on the company’s business, according to the company’s dependency on the concrete supplier. In order to prevent a big damage, the company can do the following:

1.Try to diversify the risk. The company should always avoid a full dependency on only one supplier, but to have business with more of them. This will ensure company to be more flexible and to react fast in the unexpected situations and avoid significant losses. 

2.In case when the company is forced to cooperates with only one supplier, the company should be in constant touch with the supplier and try to feel and predict an undesirable scenario, react before it happens and save itself from the losses of money and reputation.

3.In order to react as fast as possible, the company should have already elaborated and tested “escape” plan.

4.The last option could be that the company always have some supplies in the backup, which would enable the company to keep the business continuity until the company management come up with the action plan.
