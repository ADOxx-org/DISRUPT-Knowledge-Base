**Machine Unresponsive LED5**

In the production environment, there are many disruptions, that sometimes can cause significant losses to the company. In this case, if you have trouble with the functioning of the machine and you see only the blank screen that does not show anything, the following can be done:

**1.** Turn off the machine.

**2.** Check if the machine was serviced properly and timely.

**3.** Try to follow the machine’s user manual to find if the “machine unresponsive” event is described and what to do in that case.

**4.** If this case is not covered in the user manual, perform a reset on the machine, but only if it’s safe to do this.

**5.** If this does not resolve the issue, contact the machine producer for further assistance or send the machine for repair.

**6.** In the meanwhile, make sure that machine is unplugged and out of usage.
